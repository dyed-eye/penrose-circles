===========

Penrose Tiling SVG generation.

This is some golang code to generate Penrose P2 tilings in SVG.  I wrote this so that I could send the output to a laser cutter and make real life tiles to play with.

To install run:

* Have golang installed with a GOPATH set
* Run `go get github.com/jbeda/penrose-svg`
* Run `$GOPATH/bin/penrose-svg`

Or you can clone this repo and start hacking directly.

## Example (Requires an SVG capable browser)
